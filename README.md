# Shingler
Duplicate text analyzer with help of the shingle algorithm. Insert the two texts you want to compare and you will get a matching score back.

##How it works
This tool takes two texts and returns a number called the "Shingle Score". This metric is used by many SEO-Experts to measure the similarity between two texts.
The scoring is based on splitting the text into lots of smaller parts. These parts are then compared with each other and checked for matching pairs. 
The more matches are found the higher will the score be.
Shingler makes various changes to the inserted text to garantuee a more reliable score value.
  Removal of whitespaces
  Removal of stop-words
  Splitting into binominal-shingles
  Performance orientated code
